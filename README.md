Employment, Economic Disparities, and MPCE Analysis in India
Overview
This repository contains the analysis and visualization of employment trends, labor force participation, economic disparities, and Monthly Per Capita Expenditure (MPCE) in India. The study is based on data from the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) and Household Consumer Expenditure Survey (HCES), aiming to provide data-driven insights for policymakers.

Objectives
Analyze employment trends, including urban vs. rural disparities and gender gaps.

Assess income inequality across different states and social groups.

Examine MPCE variations to evaluate economic well-being.

Provide interactive visualizations using Power BI and Python-based dashboards.

Offer policy recommendations to improve economic inclusion and labor market participation.

Dataset Sources
PLFS (Periodic Labour Force Survey) – Employment and labor force participation trends.

HCES (Household Consumer Expenditure Survey) – Income distribution and expenditure patterns.

Approach
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and merging PLFS & HCES datasets using Python (Pandas, NumPy).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying key employment and expenditure trends.

Visualization:

Power BI Dashboards for interactive insights.

Matplotlib & Seaborn for in-depth statistical plots.

Geospatial Maps to highlight regional disparities.

Insights & Policy Recommendations: Presenting data-driven findings for decision-makers.

Key Findings
Higher Unemployment in Urban Areas: Due to migration pressure and sectoral dependency.

Gender Disparities: Women’s labor participation remains significantly lower, especially in rural areas.

Regional Income Inequality: High disparities in states like Delhi, Maharashtra, Karnataka, while Kerala & Himachal Pradesh show better equity.

MPCE Disparities: STs & SCs have lower MPCE; salaried workers have the highest MPCE.

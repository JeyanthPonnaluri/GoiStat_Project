## Employment, Economic Disparities, and MPCE Analysis in India

### Overview
This repository contains an in-depth analysis and visualization of employment trends, labor force participation, economic disparities, and Monthly Per Capita Expenditure (MPCE) in India. The study leverages data from the **Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS)** and **Household Consumer Expenditure Survey (HCES)** to provide data-driven insights for policymakers and researchers.

### Objectives
- Analyze employment trends, including **urban vs. rural disparities** and **gender gaps**.
- Assess **income inequality** across different states and social groups.
- Examine **MPCE variations** to evaluate economic well-being.
- Provide **interactive visualizations** using **Power BI** and **Python-based dashboards**.
- Offer **policy recommendations** to enhance economic inclusion and labor market participation.

### Dataset Sources
- **PLFS (Periodic Labour Force Survey)** – Employment and labor force participation trends.
- **HCES (Household Consumer Expenditure Survey)** – Income distribution and expenditure patterns.

### Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and merging PLFS & HCES datasets using **Python (Pandas, NumPy)**.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying key employment and expenditure trends.
3. **Visualization**:
   - **Power BI Dashboards** for interactive insights.
   - **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for statistical analysis and visual representation.
   - **Geospatial Maps** using **GeoPandas & Folium** to highlight regional disparities.
4. **Insights & Policy Recommendations**: Presenting data-driven findings for decision-makers.

### Key Findings
- **Higher Unemployment in Urban Areas**: Driven by migration pressure and sectoral dependency.
- **Gender Disparities**: Women’s labor force participation remains significantly lower, especially in rural areas.
- **Regional Income Inequality**: High disparities in states like **Delhi, Maharashtra, and Karnataka**, whereas **Kerala & Himachal Pradesh** show better equity.
- **MPCE Disparities**: **STs & SCs** report lower MPCE, while **salaried workers** have the highest MPCE.
